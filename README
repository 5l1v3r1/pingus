read the file `FAQ' if you have throuble getting things to work.

Pingus is a free Lemmings(tm) clone for Linux and other operating
systems supported by ClanLib. It can run in a lot of resolutions in X
and in fullscreen (if supported by svgalib, fbdev or OpenPTC). It is
covered under the GPL, check the file COPYING, for more informations.

It will have most features of Lemmings and some more. If you want to
have music and sound you need the pingus-sound pak, it is distributed
seperatly. You can grap it on the pingus home page.
