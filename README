Introduction

   Pingus is a free Lemmings(tm) clone for GNU/Linux, Win32 and other
   operating systems supported by ClanLib. It is covered under the GPLv2,
   check the file COPYING for more information.
   
   See `INSTALL' for instructions on how to compile and run Pingus from
   source. If you are using the static binary have a look at the file
   README.binary. You might also want to read the file `FAQ' if you have
   trouble getting things to work.
   
   Music for the game is separately available at the Pingus web page.
