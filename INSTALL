Pingus Installation Guide for GNU/Linux
=======================================

Foreword:
=========
If you run GNU/Linux on a x86 it is strongly recomment that you use
the static-binares provided at the Pingus Webpage http://pingus.seul.org.
Compiling Pingus is only needed if you run a non-x86 architekture or a
non-Linux Unix like OS.

Installation:
=============
To compile Pingus you need:

 Hermes 1.3.2  - http://www.clanlib.org/hermes/
 ClanLib 0.6.5 - http://www.clanlib.org
 libxml2       - http://www.xmlsoft.org/

For full music and sound support you also need:

 MikMod - http://www.mikmod.org/
 Vorbis - http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ 

Compile Hermes, MikMod, libxml2 and Voribs before ClanLib. To compile
ClanLib you need to apply all the patches to it from the
contrib/clanlib/ subdirectory to it, without them Pingus will have a
few non-critical bugs. Once all libraries are in place, compile Pingus
with:

 % ./configure
 % make

You can now run Pingus directly from the src/ subdirectory. If you
want to install Pingus, which is required if you want to have the i18n
support working, just type:

 % make install

For non-root installs use something like:

 % ./configure --prefix=/home/juser
 % make 
 % make install

Starting Pingus can be done by:

 % src/pingus

If you have a slow machine, starting Pingus with:

 % src/pingus -g 640x480 --frame-skip 3

Might lead to a better playable game. Fullscreen support is available via:

 % src/pingus --fullscreen
