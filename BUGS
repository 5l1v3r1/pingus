Pingus BUGS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

* Pressing Armageddon crashes the game from time to time
* While loading a level it sometimes quits with a message that a
  resource wasn't found, but the resource should be pressent
* Sound Support is very primitive
* Music support isn't much tested
* Zooming is broken
* Some non Critical Errors (file not found, etc.)  quit Pingus, when
  it still should be able to contiune
* Bridger's bridges are put wrongly to the colmap
* Extremly short mouse clicks are not registered (its a bug in
  ClanLibs event system)
* Shift selection in editor can capture an object twice

'grep' at the sources for "Bug" or "FIXME" that should give you some
more known bugs and other stuff.
