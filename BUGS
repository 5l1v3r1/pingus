Pingus BUGS:
------------
* The game might crash, if you start a level with the quick play
  button twice 
* The command line options are a bit wired and sometimes not up to date
* probably not completly C++ namespace clean
* Sound Support is very primitive or not implemented, same for Music support
* Zooming is broken
* Other resolution than 640x480 might cause some throuble with the GUI
* Some non Critical Errors quit Pingus, when it still should be able to contiune

'grep' at the sources for 'Bug' or "FIXME" that should give you some
more known bugs and other stuff.
