Pingus BUGS:
------------
* The command line options are a bit wired and sometimes not up to date
* probably not completly C++ namespace clean
* Sound Support is very primitive or not implemented, same for Music support
* Zooming is broken
* Some non Critical Errors quit Pingus, when it still should be able to contiune
* After some minutes of playing the game begans havyly to swap and
  ends 

'grep' at the sources for 'Bug' or "FIXME" that should give you some
more known bugs and other stuff.
