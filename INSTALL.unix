Pingus Installation Guide for GNU/Linux
=======================================

Foreword:
=========
If you run GNU/Linux on a x86 it is strongly recomment that you use
the static-binares provided at the Pingus Webpage http://pingus.seul.org.
Compiling Pingus is only needed if you run a non-x86 architekture or a
non-Linux Unix like OS (FreeBSD, GNU/Hurd or something like that).


Installation:
=============
To compile Pingus you need:

 Hermes 1.3.2  - http://www.clanlib.org/hermes/
 ClanLib 0.6.5 - http://www.clanlib.org
 libxml2       - http://www.xmlsoft.org/

For full music and sound support you also need:

 MikMod - http://www.mikmod.org/
 Vorbis - http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ 

Compile Hermes, MikMod, libxml2 and Voribs before ClanLib. To compile
ClanLib you need to apply all the patches to it from the
contrib/clanlib/ subdirectory to it, without them Pingus will have a
few bugs (editor windows have a close button, which on click results
in freeze or crash, console will be showable/hidable with many keys,
scrollwheel support will be missing). Once all libraries are in place,
compile Pingus with:

 % ./configure
 % make

You can now run Pingus directly from the src/ subdirectory. If you
want to install Pingus, which is required if you want to have the i18n
support working, just type:

 % make install

For non-root installs use something like:

 % ./configure --prefix=/home/juser
 % make 
 % make install

Starting Pingus can be done by:

 % src/pingus

If you have a slow machine, starting Pingus with:

 % src/pingus -g 640x480 --frame-skip 3

Might lead to a better playable game. Fullscreen support is available via:

 % src/pingus --fullscreen


OpenGL Support:
===============

In addition to the normal X11 support, Pingus can also be compiled
with OpenGL support, to do so you just need to make sure that you have
ClanGL compiled and installed (its part of ClanLib) and then compile
Pingus with:

 % ./configure --with-clanGL
 % make

You need than to start Pingus with:

 % src/pingus --use-opengl

But note, that OpenGL support is buggy and lead to visual artifacts,
OpenGL graphic cards with a texturesize of 1024x1024 or lower will
also cause throuble and be unable to display the Worldmap.
