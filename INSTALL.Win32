Introduction

   The following instructions are only tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 6
   and Visual Studio .NET 2003.
   
   To be able to compile pingus you need a working version of ClanLib 0.7.8 
   or later which is correct installed. You should have both debug and release
   builds of the libraries.
   
   Please read also the normal INSTALL documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
1. Requirements for compiling Pingus

   First of all you need a Win32 operating system with Visual Studio installed.
 
   To compile Pingus you will need the following libraries:
   
	-> ClanLib 
	(Download at http://www.clanlib.org/download/)
	
	-> libxml2
	-> iconv
	(Download at http://www.fh-frankfurt.de/~igor/projects/libxml/index.html)
    
   To compile ClanLib by yourself you will need several other libraries:

	-> DirectX 8/8.1 SDK
	(Download at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/downloads/list/directx.asp)
	
	-> ZLib 
	-> LibJPEG
	-> LibPNG
	-> MikMod
	-> Vorbis

	-> ClanLib itself
	(Download at http://www.clanlib.org/)

    To make it easy, ClanLib provides all these external libs (dx8, xml, iconv,
    zlib, jpeg, png, mikmod, vorbis) available in their External Libs package.
    (Download at http://www.clanlib.org/~sphair/download/external/ExternalLibs.zip)
    
    If you download this package, you only need to download ClanLib and nothing more
    to compile both ClanLib and Pingus.
    
	The sources of ClanLib can also be found in the CVS tree 
	(see Pingus website for more information).

2. Compile ClanLib (for further istructions read the INSTALL.win32 file
		    included in the ClanLib package)	

   First step is to make sure all above mentioned libs are in the right place
   (a place where MSVC++ can link against them). If you use diffrent paths 
   than your global include and lib path, you have to tell VC++: 

   Developer Studio .NET 2003:
   Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories
   Add the Include and Lib paths to "Include Files", and "Library Files".

   Developer Studio 6:
   Extras->Optionen - tab Verzeichnisse    #########FIXME: Dunno how the menunames are in english :-( , someone please translate

   After the libs are in the right place, you can open the configure.dsw for 
   building the configure.exe file (see ClanLib documentation for more info).
   
   Execute the configure.exe. You must enter some information which
   is necessary to build the ClanLib.dsw file which is the REAL workspace for
   compiling ClanLib.

   For Pingus you have to compile the following projects of the ClanLib 
   workspace (ClanLib.dsw):

	-> clanApp
	-> clanCore
	-> clanDisplay
	-> clanGL
	-> clanGUI
	-> clanJPEG
	-> clanMikMod
	-> clanNetwork
	-> clanPNG
	-> clanSignals
	-> clanSound
	-> clanVorbis
   
   The projects should be compiled with the "Win32 Release" configuration
   (toolbar "Build").
   ClanLib has its own script, which copies the built library in the path which
   you entered in the configure.exe.

3. Compile Pingus

   Before compiling Pingus under VC 6, you have to execute the vcfix.reg.
   It adds support for .cc and .cxx files to Visual C++ 6. This is not
   neccessary under Visual Studio .NET.

   Open Pingus.dsw for VC 6, or Pingus.sln for VC.NET 2003, change the active
   configuration to the "Win32 Release" build (toolbar "Build") and compile it.
   
   If Pingus (or any other library) does not compile correctly, please inform
   the Pingus developer mailing list (see Pingus homepage for information
   about the mailing list)

4. Run Pingus

   Pingus needs some DLLs, namely iconv.dll, intl.dll and libxml2.dll. Copy
   these into the Pingus main dir. They are included in the External Libs
   package from clanlib.org.
   
   Hit Ctrl-F5 to run Pingus.
