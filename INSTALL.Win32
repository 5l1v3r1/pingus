Introduction

   The following instructions are only tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.
   To be able to compile pingus you need a working version of ClanLib
   which is correct installed. You need also a working version of
   ClanMagick. You should have both debug and release builds of the
   librarys.
   Please read also the normal INSTALL documentation.

   installed (see Introduction).

   You have to execute the vcfix.reg. It adds support for .cc files to
   Visual C++.

   You have to copy the win32\config.h into the directory where your global
   includes are.
