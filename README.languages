Pingus currently has Locale support for the following Languages

        cs_CZ -> Czech /             (ISO-8859-2)
        de_DE -> German / Deutsch    (ISO-8859-1)
        en_US -> English - default   (ISO-8859-1)
        tr_TR -> Turkish / Türkçe    (ISO-8859-9/ISO-8859-1)
	it_IT -> Italian / Italyano  (ISO-8859-1)
        sv_SE ->                     (ISO-8859-1)
        sr_SR ->                     (ISO-8859-2)

Unfinished:
	nl -> Dutch / Nederlands

If your environment is already set so that you are able to
see (some) applications in the desired Language, Pingus
should start directly in that language.

However, to start it directly with the language you want 
you should start Pingus as follows ...

	LANG=tr_TR pingus

This sets the system variable 'LANG' to the value of 
'tr_TR' (in this example). 

The notation may be a bit confusing.  The two lowercase
letters are use to denote the language, usually the 
two letter ISO code of the country the language is
spoken in.

After the underscore (_), the two uppercase letters denote
the country. Again the two letter ISO country code is used.

some examples

	en_US  - English  United States
	en_UK  - English  United Kingdom
	nl_NL  - Dutch    Holland/Netherlands
	...
