Maintaining Pingus
==================

Source Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source releases can be created with a call to 

 % make dist-bzip2

that will generate a tarball called pingus-VERSION.tar.bz2, a call to

 % make dist-gzip

will generated a gzipped one and a call to:

 % make dist-zip

should generate a zipped one for the Windows people.

One has to be carefull to to check the created tarball if it contains
all graphics, etc. a call to:

 % make distcheck

might help, but might not be sufficient, further testing might be
needed (FIXME: should be automatised).


Binary Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Binary release are different, they are basically build by a

 % make install prefix=/tmp/pingus/
 % cp -v pingus.static /tmp/pingus/usr/local/games/pingus

and by adding a start script, using the Loki Installer might also be a
good idea, even so I tend to prefer tarballs, it automatically creates
KDE and Gnome links and such.

FIXME: a make-target should automatise this.
FIXME: Binary Release should include source code (source is small, so
it should be shipped together with the binary)
FIXME: How to build windows binaries?


What to Release?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source Release as .zip and .tar.bz2, .tar.gz shouldn't be needed.
Binary Release as tar.bz2 for GNU/Linux and .zip for Windows, some
people might prefer a clickable .exe.
