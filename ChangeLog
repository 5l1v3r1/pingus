	  scrolling

2007-08-05 16:24  jave27

	* Change
	  method
	  of
	  setting
	  verbosity
	  level.
	  
	  The
	  previous

	  to
	  the
	  change
	  in

	  line
	  arguments
	  are
	  processed.

2007-08-05 05:22  jsalmon3

	* Moved

	  only,
	  enabled
	  credits

2007-08-05 03:21  jsalmon3

	* Fixed

	  to
	  wobble
	  when
	  scrolling

2007-08-05 03:03  jsalmon3

	  enabled
	  number_fnt

2007-08-04 14:17  grumbel

	* -

2007-08-04 05:52  jsalmon3

	  svn:executable

2007-08-04 02:18  jsalmon3

	* Use
	  SDL's
	  clip
	  rect
	  instead
	  of
	  the
	  screen
	  size
	  for
	  clipping
	  lines

2007-08-04 02:12  jsalmon3

	* Add
	  pathfinder
	  to
	  cache,
	  fix
	  memory
	  leak

2007-08-04 02:03  jsalmon3

	* Don't
	  delete
	  actions[i].child
	  since
	  the
	  gui
	  manager
	  also
	  deletes
	  it.
	  
	  draw_line
	  should
	  use
	  translate_stack

2007-08-04 01:10  jsalmon3

2007-08-04 00:05  jave27

	* Enable
	  the
	  save
	  feature
	  in
	  the
	  level
	  editor. InputBoxes
	  don't
	  currently
	  work,
	  so
	  you
	  can't
	  actually
	  type
	  a
	  filename
	  yet
	  to
	  save,
	  though.

2007-08-03 23:49  jave27

	* -
	  Rename
	  XMLLevel
	  to
	  EditorLevel
	  and
	  get
	  rid
	  of
	  references
	  to
	  XML
	  FileReader/Writer. -
	  Move
	  the
	  EditorViewport's
	  z-position
	  up
	  so
	  the
	  level
	  objects
	  are
	  actually
	  visible. Now,
	  we
	  just
	  need
	  a
	  SExprFileWriter
	  class,
	  and
	  the
	  save()
	  functionality
	  can
	  be
	  enabled. Plenty
	  of
	  GUI
	  functionality
	  still
	  needs
	  improvment,
	  too
	  (piece
	  selection,
	  etc.).

	  name
	  next
	  to
	  the

	  when
	  the
	  mouse
	  is
	  on
	  it

2007-08-02 06:03  jsalmon3

	* Wait
	  to
	  initialize

	  in
	  Linux.

	* -
	  added
	  surface
	  rotation

	  for
	  gfxmap

2007-08-02 02:44  jsalmon3

2006-02-11 14:32  grumbel

	* Started
	  Pingus-SDL
	  branch

2006-02-09 15:07  jave27

	* Updated
	  MSVC
	  project
	  and
	  cleaned
	  up
	  some
	  more
	  type
	  conversion
	  warnings. Fixed
	  a
	  path
	  error
	  for
	  WIN32
	  systems
	  with
	  home
	  directories
	  residing
	  on
	  places
	  other
	  than
	  the
	  C:\.

2006-02-05 20:49  jave27

	* Added
	  a
	  way
	  to
	  edit
	  the
	  level
	  name
	  and
	  description
	  in
	  the
	  editor..
	  
	  A
	  bit
	  ugly
	  at
	  the
	  moment,
	  but
	  it
	  works.

2006-01-24 01:44  jave27

	* Locked
	  file
	  dialog
	  inputbox
	  during
	  loading
	  to
	  prevent
	  users
	  from
	  accessing
	  unopened
	  levels/worlds. Enabled
	  the
	  file
	  dialog
	  box
	  for
	  the
	  editor
	  so
	  you
	  can
	  pick
	  the
	  name
	  of
	  the
	  saved
	  level.

2006-01-23 23:55  jave27

	* Making
	  the
	  file
	  dialog
	  box
	  better
	  by
	  hacking
	  up
	  the
	  input
	  box.

2006-01-23 18:22  jave27

	* Updated
	  MSVC
	  project
	  and
	  got
	  rid
	  of
	  some
	  more
	  float->int
	  conversion
	  warnings.

2006-01-23 05:00  jave27

	* Input
	  working
	  much
	  better
	  now.
	  
	  Added
	  
	  "focussed"
	  component
	  to
	  the
	  GUI
	  Manager.

2006-01-23 04:48  jave27

	* Added
	  preliminary
	  keyboard
	  input
	  ability.
	  
	  Isn't
	  working
	  very
	  well
	  yet,
	  but
	  keys
	  are
	  being
	  caught
	  at
	  least.
	  
	  We
	  need
	  this
	  for
	  the
	  editor
	  and
	  the
	  file
	  dialog
	  box.

2006-01-23 02:35  jave27

	* Editor
	  takes
	  "translation
	  origin"
	  of
	  a
	  sprite
	  into
	  account
	  now
	  when
	  drawing.

2006-01-22 15:12  jave27

	* Credits
	  no
	  longer
	  show
	  up

	  (oops)

2006-01-20 04:44  jave27

	* Got
	  rid
	  of
	  some
	  minor
	  gcc
	  -Wall
	  issues.

2006-01-19 22:18  jave27

	* Added
	  the
	  "finished"
	  status
	  to
	  appear
	  in
	  the
	  dialog
	  box.

2006-01-19 22:11  jave27

	* Fixed
	  some
	  bugs
	  with
	  the
	  metamap.
	  
	  Hardcoded
	  the
	  unlock
	  for
	  the
	  volcano
	  map
	  after
	  tutorial
	  is
	  finished
	  (needs
	  to
	  be
	  updated). Re-enabled
	  the
	  credits
	  (after
	  the
	  final
	  map's
	  end
	  story
	  is
	  shown).

2006-01-19 19:57  jave27

	* Error
	  caught
	  by
	  gcc
	  &
	  not
	  VS.net

2006-01-19 19:49  jave27

	* Fixed
	  dumb
	  mistake.

2006-01-19 19:42  jave27

	* Added
	  a
	  metamap
	  to
	  connect
	  the
	  worldmaps. Rearranged
	  a
	  lot
	  of
	  stuff..
	  The
	  level
	  name
	  that's
	  stored
	  in
	  the
	  StatManager
	  is
	  now
	  the
	  actual
	  levelname
	  from
	  the
	  .pingus
	  file
	  (unless
	  blank),
	  so
	  the
	  old
	  savegames.xml
	  file
	  won't
	  be
	  effective
	  anymore. Also
	  added
	  some
	  things
	  to
	  the
	  variables.xml
	  file. More
	  general
	  cleanup,
	  too.
	  
	  Big
	  commit...

2006-01-19 01:56  jave27

	* Enabled
	  woodthing
	  (mostly).

2006-01-19 01:29  jave27

	* Removed
	  a
	  bunch
	  of
	  old
	  GameCounter
	  objects
	  and
	  old
	  comments.

2006-01-19 00:57  jave27

	* Z
	  issue
	  was
	  the
	  surface_background
	  -
	  it
	  wasn't
	  taking
	  account
	  of
	  the
	  pos.z
	  when
	  it
	  tiled
	  the
	  screen. Updated
	  spike
	  get_pos()
	  calls.

2006-01-19 00:38  jave27

	* Fixed
	  issue
	  with
	  jumper
	  changing
	  direction. Reverted
	  Z
	  position
	  hack
	  -
	  leveldots
	  disappeared
	  after
	  I
	  did
	  it. Bypassed
	  entire
	  ScreenManager::fade_over()
	  function
	  -
	  it
	  doesn't
	  work
	  well
	  for
	  most
	  screen
	  changes.

2006-01-18 22:07  jave27

	* Updated
	  some
	  syntax
	  -
	  removed
	  GameCounter
	  option
	  from
	  the
	  draw(sprite...)
	  functions
	  since
	  it
	  shouldn't
	  be
	  used
	  anyway. Removed
	  Z
	  handling
	  from
	  the
	  SpriteDrawingRequests
	  because
	  sprites
	  with
	  a
	  negative
	  Z
	  value
	  weren't
	  being
	  drawn.
	  
	  This
	  needs
	  to
	  be
	  fixed
	  correctly,
	  but
	  this
	  is
	  a
	  workaround
	  for
	  now.

2006-01-18 20:28  jave27

	* Updated
	  spike
	  code
	  to
	  display
	  again. Found
	  another
	  bug
	  that
	  hides
	  WorldObj's
	  when
	  they
	  are
	  layered...
	  
	  It's
	  only
	  drawing
	  the
	  top
	  Z
	  position
	  in
	  some
	  cases.
	  
	  Temporary
	  fix:
	  moved
	  the
	  spike
	  in
	  that
	  level
	  to
	  z=0.

2006-01-18 19:55  jave27

	* Added
	  a
	  default
	  starting
	  level
	  to
	  the
	  Worldmap
	  XML
	  file,
	  and
	  changed
	  the
	  code
	  to
	  actually
	  use
	  it
	  unless
	  a
	  node
	  is
	  specified
	  in
	  the
	  variables.xml
	  file. Prior
	  to
	  this,
	  a
	  user
	  was
	  starting
	  off
	  in
	  strange
	  places
	  in
	  the
	  volcano
	  worldmap.

2006-01-18 18:35  jave27

	* Fixed
	  minor
	  bug
	  where
	  level
	  names
	  showed
	  up
	  beneath
	  dots
	  on
	  the
	  worldmap.

2006-01-18 18:12  jave27

	* Sped
	  up
	  screen
	  changes
	  a
	  bit.
	  
	  The
	  animation
	  still
	  doesn't
	  work
	  all
	  that
	  well. Updated
	  combobox
	  label
	  and
	  VC
	  Project
	  file.

2006-01-18 15:01  jave27

	* Editor
	  can
	  add
	  new
	  groundpiece
	  objects
	  now. Reworked
	  Combobox
	  a
	  bit
	  more. Took
	  care
	  of
	  a
	  bunch
	  of
	  MSVC
	  compile/type
	  conversion
	  warnings

2006-01-17 02:49  jave27

	* Prepped
	  the
	  GUI
	  Manager
	  and
	  component
	  for
	  keyboard
	  input. Patching

	  in
	  volcano
	  to
	  allow
	  pingus
	  to
	  leave
	  the
	  exit
	  (might
	  need
	  to
	  revert
	  this
	  one)

2006-01-17 02:29  jave27

	* Changed
	  the
	  checkbox
	  images
	  and
	  moved
	  it
	  around
	  a
	  bit.

2006-01-17 01:32  jave27

	* Fixed
	  a
	  bunch
	  of
	  screen
	  resolution
	  issues.
	  
	  Some
	  are
	  hacks,
	  but
	  still
	  much
	  better
	  than
	  previously.

2006-01-17 00:55  jave27

	* Fixed
	  the
	  "bouncing"
	  issue
	  when
	  the
	  screen
	  resolution
	  is
	  bigger
	  than
	  the
	  level.

2006-01-17 00:11  jave27

	* Changed
	  CL_Surface
	  on
	  Smallmap
	  to
	  CL_Sprite
	  as
	  ClanLib
	  has
	  odd
	  issues
	  with
	  Surfaces
	  on
	  some
	  platforms.
	  
	  Plus,
	  they
	  seem
	  to
	  operate
	  differently
	  in
	  SDL
	  vs.
	  GL
	  mode.

2006-01-16 13:34  jave27

	* Updated
	  EOL
	  style
	  on
	  new
	  files. Update
	  MSVC
	  project Changed
	  snap-to
	  default
	  to
	  false.

2006-01-16 05:01  jave27

	* Actually
	  added
	  the
	  checkbox
	  files
	  this
	  time,
	  plus
	  added
	  one
	  to
	  the
	  editor
	  panel.

2006-01-16 04:46  jave27

	* Fixed
	  all
	  the
	  gcc
	  -Wall
	  issues
	  (mostly
	  my
	  bad). The
	  Scons
	  script
	  works
	  again. Added
	  a
	  Checkbox
	  object.

2006-01-16 02:52  jave27

	* Gave
	  Combobox
	  class
	  a
	  "selected"
	  highlight
	  box
	  when
	  it's
	  in
	  drop-down
	  mode. Removed
	  test
	  output
	  from
	  groundpiece
	  button.

2006-01-16 02:35  jave27

	* -
	  Can
	  now
	  start
	  the
	  editor
	  with
	  the
	  -e
	  command
	  line. -
	  Prepared
	  the
	  Resource
	  class
	  to
	  return
	  sections
	  of
	  the
	  underlying
	  CL_ResourceManager.

2006-01-15 02:08  jave27

	* Updated
	  editor
	  item
	  interaction
	  a
	  little
	  more.

2006-01-14 23:34  jave27

	* Added
	  a
	  groundpiece
	  button
	  to
	  the
	  editor
	  and
	  re-organized
	  the
	  Combobox
	  class
	  a
	  little.

2006-01-12 23:06  jave27

	* Applied
	  Sean
	  Heber's
	  patch
	  to
	  use
	  clanGL
	  for
	  MacOSX
	  and
	  updated
	  the
	  xcode
	  project
	  file.

2006-01-11 18:06  jave27

	* Fixed
	  the
	  line
	  between
	  scaled
	  background
	  images
	  -
	  it's
	  an
	  artifact
	  of
	  how
	  ClanLib
	  treats
	  CL_Surface's
	  vs.
	  CL_Sprite's.
	  
	  I
	  changed
	  it
	  to
	  use
	  sprites
	  instead,
	  plus
	  now
	  it
	  doesn't
	  scale
	  unless
	  the
	  resolution
	  is
	  other
	  than
	  800x600.

2006-01-11 17:44  jave27

	* Fixed
	  some
	  type
	  conversion
	  issues.
	  
	  The
	  Blitter
	  scaling
	  of
	  the
	  main
	  menu
	  leaves
	  a
	  small
	  gap
	  between
	  the
	  scaled
	  and
	  scrolling
	  images
	  in
	  OpenGL
	  mode,
	  though.

2006-01-10 17:44  jave27

	* Made
	  a
	  lot
	  of
	  changes
	  to
	  enable
	  resolutions
	  other
	  than
	  800x600
	  to
	  work
	  correctly. Still
	  not
	  perfect,
	  but
	  much
	  closer,
	  plus
	  this
	  fixed
	  a
	  blitter
	  scaling
	  issue
	  with
	  indexed
	  pngs. Removed
	  some
	  old
	  blitter
	  code.

2006-01-09 21:28  jave27

	* Added
	  (very)
	  basic
	  z
	  position
	  changes
	  to
	  editor.

2006-01-09 18:17  jave27

	* Editor
	  takes
	  translation
	  origin
	  into
	  account
	  when
	  loading
	  object
	  now.

2006-01-09 16:36  jave27

	* Setup
	  method
	  for
	  displaying
	  objects
	  w/o
	  a
	  real
	  surface,
	  starting
	  with
	  the
	  entrances.

2006-01-09 07:08  jave27

	* Updated
	  some
	  of
	  the
	  linux
	  instructions.

2006-01-07 05:16  jave27

	* Added
	  "set
	  direction"
	  ability
	  in
	  editor
	  -
	  doesn't
	  actually
	  work,
	  though,
	  since
	  Entrance
	  objects
	  don't
	  have
	  sprites
	  at
	  the
	  moment.
	  
	  TODO.

2006-01-06 18:03  jave27

	* eol
	  style
	  update
	  for
	  newer

	  ability
	  to
	  change
	  owner
	  in
	  editor
	  (for
	  exits
	  at
	  least). TODO:
	  
	  Account
	  for
	  translation
	  origin
	  in
	  sprites,
	  and
	  also
	  look
	  at
	  entrance
	  code
	  -
	  combine
	  a
	  hotspot
	  w/
	  and
	  entrance
	  instead
	  of
	  making
	  them
	  2
	  separate
	  objects?

2006-01-05 20:30  jave27

	* Re-arranged
	  globals.cxx
	  and
	  got
	  rid
	  of
	  some
	  redundancy

2006-01-05 20:24  jave27

	* Moved
	  the
	  'use_opengl'
	  variable
	  declaration
	  back
	  to
	  where
	  it
	  should
	  be.
	  
	  Not
	  sure
	  if
	  we
	  want
	  to
	  default
	  to
	  SDL
	  for
	  non-Windows
	  systems
	  or
	  not...
	  
	  Can
	  revisit
	  later.

2006-01-05 20:13  jave27

	* Updated

	  script
	  (not
	  tested)

	  grayscale
	  png.

	* Fixed
	  the
	  heap
	  overflow
	  issue
	  -
	  it
	  was
	  trying
	  to
	  rotate
	  a
	  null
	  sprite.

2005-12-29 21:18  jave27

	* Allow
	  multiple
	  objects
	  to
	  be
	  selected/draggged,
	  etc
	  in
	  the
	  editor. Selecting
	  the
	  exits
	  isn't
	  quite
	  working
	  due
	  to
	  the
	  translation_origin
	  tag
	  in
	  the
	  sprite. Selecting
	  a
	  bunch
	  of
	  objects
	  and
	  rotating
	  them
	  causes
	  heap
	  overflows.

2005-12-29 19:10  jave27

	* Prettied

	  file
	  dialog

	  context
	  menu
	  to

	  function
	  work. Made
	  the
	  file
	  dialog
	  display
	  the
	  filename
	  if
	  the
	  description
	  was
	  blank.

2005-12-28 18:58  jave27

	* Moved
	  the
	  pop_menu
	  function
	  back
	  out
	  to
	  the
	  main
	  menu
	  instead
	  of
	  inside

	  dialog
	  box.

2005-12-28 17:53  jave27

	* Added
	  file
	  dialog

	* Added
	  a
	  command
	  line
	  arg.
	  to
	  force
	  SDL
	  mode. Set
	  GL
	  to
	  be
	  default
	  on
	  Windows,
	  and
	  SDL
	  to
	  be
	  default
	  on
	  Linux.
	  
	  There
	  are
	  some
	  bugs
	  in

	  a
	  bunch
	  of
	  compile
	  errors
	  (missing
	  newline
	  at
	  end
	  of
	  file,
	  DOS
	  line

	  incorrect
	  case

	  etc.)

2005-12-01 15:43  jave27

	* Fixed
	  some
	  case
	  issues.

2005-12-01 14:46  jave27

	* Added
	  a
	  new
	  File
	  Dialog
	  for
	  selecting
	  levels
	  and
	  folders.
	  
	  Needs
	  to
	  be
	  expanded
	  to
	  handle
	  Worldmaps,
	  and
	  a
	  few
	  more
	  features
	  are
	  needed.
	  
	  But,
	  it
	  works
	  for
	  now.

2005-11-21 19:53  jave27

	* Replaced
	  all
	  System::translate()
	  calls
	  with
	  calls
	  to
	  the
	  tinygettext
	  _()
	  function
	  instead. Made
	  the
	  exit
	  visible
	  in
	  a
	  few
	  more
	  volcano
	  levels. Still
	  TODO:
	  Create
	  .po
	  files
	  for
	  each
	  worldmap
	  folder
	  for
	  new
	  translations,
	  and
	  read
	  them
	  in
	  when
	  loading
	  the
	  worldmap.

2005-11-19 02:15  jave27

	* Make
	  hellmouth14-grumbel.pingus
	  playable.

2005-11-18 21:08  jave27

	* Cleaned
	  up
	  the
	  savegame
	  manager
	  XML
	  code. Fixed
	  the
	  worldmap
	  so
	  it
	  pulls
	  worldmap
	  information
	  from
	  the
	  XML
	  file
	  instead
	  of
	  hard-coding
	  it. More
	  general
	  cleanup
	  to
	  get
	  rid
	  of
	  some
	  compiler
	  warnings. Made
	  the
	  exit
	  visible
	  on
	  the
	  hellmouth14-grumbel.pingus
	  level. Some
	  of
	  the
	  leveldots
	  are
	  inaccessible
	  in
	  volcano
	  still.

2005-11-18 16:22  jave27

	* Moved
	  the
	  currently
	  in-use
	  hellmouth
	  levels
	  to
	  the
	  volcano/
	  folder. Fixed
	  the
	  hellmouth1
	  level
	  to
	  be
	  playable
	  (still
	  needs
	  some
	  tweaking
	  on
	  the
	  release
	  rate
	  and
	  time
	  possibly) Volcano
	  worldmap
	  now
	  loads
	  and
	  first
	  level
	  is
	  playable
	  (needs
	  a
	  lot
	  of
	  tweaking
	  still,
	  though) Switch/Door
	  traps
	  work
	  again. Couple
	  of
	  other
	  minor
	  cleanups.

2005-11-18 03:29  jave27

	* Fixed
	  a
	  bug
	  with
	  ROT90
	  blitter
	  rotation.
	  
	  Uses
	  BlitterImpl
	  for
	  ROT90
	  like
	  the
	  rest
	  of
	  the
	  rotation
	  modifiers
	  now. Also
	  fixed
	  the
	  exit
	  location
	  on
	  one
	  of
	  the
	  levels.

2005-11-18 02:26  jave27

	* Fixed
	  a
	  Blitter
	  bug
	  for
	  non-Mac
	  systems.

2005-11-17 17:42  jave27

	* More
	  editor
	  stuff.
	  
	  The
	  editor
	  can
	  successfully
	  load
	  a
	  level
	  into
	  memory
	  and
	  save
	  it
	  back
	  out.
	  
	  Some
	  objects
	  may
	  be
	  incomplete
	  (such
	  as
	  traps)
	  at
	  the
	  moment.
	  
	  It
	  can
	  also
	  now
	  do
	  a
	  very
	  basic
	  (incorrect)
	  drawing
	  of
	  each
	  of
	  the
	  sprites
	  represented
	  by
	  the
	  level
	  object.

2005-11-16 06:43  jave27

	* Right,
	  it
	  actually
	  helps
	  to
	  mark
	  the
	  files
	  you
	  want
	  to
	  add.
	  
	  :-)
	  
	  More
	  editor
	  stuff.

2005-11-16 03:57  jave27

	* Added
	  some
	  more
	  framework
	  to
	  the
	  editor
	  to
	  load
	  Level
	  Objects.

2005-11-16 02:56  jave27

	* Backed
	  up
	  the
	  wiki
	  and
	  added
	  a
	  script
	  to
	  be
	  able
	  to
	  back
	  it
	  up
	  in
	  the
	  future.
	  
	  Feel
	  free
	  to
	  delete
	  this
	  if
	  you
	  don't
	  think
	  it
	  belongs
	  here. Also
	  added
	  some
	  more
	  level
	  editor
	  stuff.
	  
	  It
	  currently
	  loads
	  part
	  of
	  a
	  level
	  into
	  memory
	  then
	  can
	  write
	  it
	  back
	  out
	  to
	  a
	  file.
	  
	  Not
	  much,
	  but
	  it's
	  a
	  start.

2005-11-15 14:00  jave27

	* A
	  little
	  more
	  stuff
	  for
	  the
	  editor
	  and
	  some
	  clean
	  up.

2005-11-15 03:10  jave27

	* Some
	  more
	  framework
	  stuff
	  for
	  the
	  editor.

2005-11-14 22:05  jave27

	* Made
	  stupid
	  CPU
	  hack
	  actually
	  reduce
	  the
	  CPU
	  usage...
	  still
	  a
	  hack.

2005-11-14 21:51  torangan

	* recompressed

2005-11-14 21:22  jave27

	* Set
	  default
	  owner_id
	  on
	  entrances
	  and
	  exits
	  in
	  case
	  they
	  aren't
	  specified
	  in
	  the
	  level
	  file.
	  
	  This
	  fixes
	  a
	  lot
	  of
	  unplayable
	  levels
	  in
	  the
	  playable/
	  folder.

2005-11-14 18:19  jave27

	* Fixed
	  the
	  colmap
	  removal
	  for
	  certain
	  image
	  types
	  (recently
	  broken
	  by
	  me) Also,
	  fixed
	  one
	  of
	  the
	  image
	  layers
	  to
	  be
	  800
	  pixels
	  wide
	  instead
	  of
	  799.
	  
	  Still
	  needs
	  to
	  be
	  re-compressed.

2005-11-14 16:40  jave27

	* Fixed
	  a
	  couple
	  of
	  minor
	  issues
	  on
	  some
	  of
	  the
	  tutorial
	  levels.

2005-11-14 16:05  jave27

	* Changed
	  surface
	  background
	  to
	  a
	  CL_Sprite
	  to
	  fix
	  the
	  issue
	  with
	  drawing
	  a
	  dividing
	  line
	  between
	  tiled
	  backgrounds.
	  
	  Also
	  commented
	  out
	  a
	  "workaround"
	  which
	  further
	  fixed
	  the
	  issue.

2005-11-14 14:08  jave27

	* Applied
	  Sean
	  Heber's
	  (BigZaphod's)
	  MacOSX
	  patch.
	  
	  Pingus
	  can
	  now
	  compile
	  and
	  run
	  on
	  MacOSX.

2005-11-10 20:38  jave27

	* Fixed
	  some
	  sound
	  stuff,
	  put
	  letsgo.wav
	  back
	  in
	  the
	  sound
	  folder
	  
	  (found
	  online). Also,
	  applied
	  BigZaphod's
	  MacOSX
	  patch
	  for
	  finding
	  the
	  correct
	  path.
	  
	  Pingus
	  now
	  compiles
	  and
	  runs
	  on
	  MacOSX
	  until
	  it
	  hits
	  the
	  actual
	  level,
	  then
	  everything
	  in
	  the
	  Playfield
	  is
	  black.

2005-11-10 17:09  jave27

	* Minor
	  windows
	  path
	  cleanup.

2005-11-10 16:38  jave27

	* Implemented
	  a
	  rudimentary
	  GUI::Combobox
	  widget,
	  and
	  tested
	  it
	  on
	  the
	  editor. Also,
	  hacked
	  the
	  surface_background.cxx
	  again
	  to
	  try
	  to
	  remove
	  the
	  dividing
	  line
	  that's
	  caused
	  by
	  scrolling
	  backgrounds
	  which
	  are
	  blitter
	  scaled.

2005-11-10 01:52  jave27

	* More
	  level
	  editor
	  stuff.

2005-11-09 22:06  jave27

	* Managed
	  to
	  break
	  the
	  display
	  of
	  the
	  editor,
	  but
	  more
	  is
	  completed. Also
	  cleaned
	  up
	  old
	  unused
	  playfield.cxx
	  code.

2005-11-09 18:38  jave27

	* Added
	  the
	  beginnings
	  of
	  a
	  new
	  level
	  editor. A
	  little
	  more
	  cleanup. Updated
	  the
	  MSVC
	  2003
	  project
	  file
	  that
	  was
	  in
	  SVN
	  (it
	  was
	  very
	  out
	  of
	  date). Someone
	  should
	  double-check
	  my
	  Makefile.am
	  changes
	  because
	  I'm
	  developing
	  with
	  MSVC,
	  and
	  not
	  on
	  Linux.
	  
	  It
	  looks
	  right,
	  but
	  I'm
	  unsure.

2005-11-08 02:14  jave27

	* Updated
	  surface_background
	  to
	  display
	  correctly.
	  
	  There
	  is
	  still
	  a
	  line
	  that
	  divides
	  certain
	  images
	  when
	  scaled
	  with
	  the
	  blitter
	  functions,
	  though.

2005-11-07 03:50  jave27

	* Test
	  commit
	  -
	  remove
	  old
	  blitter
	  function
	  that's
	  no
	  longer
	  used.

2002-06-20 12:36  torangan

	* -
	  no
	  need
	  to
	  enforce
	  memory
	  leaks -
	  evtenualle
	  we
	  should
	  initialize
	  the
	  pointers
	  to
	  0
	  so
	  that
	  it
	  would
	  be
	  safe

	* -
	  some
	  more

	  auto_ptr
	  stuff,

	  copying
	  them
	  (I
	  know
	  that
	  resulted
	  in
	  a
	  mem-hole,
	  but
	  this
	  Multiplayer
	  stuff
	  needs
	  a
	  rewrite

	  is
	  dead -
	  reactivated
	  check

	  fixes
	  the

	  that
	  the
	  level
	  end

2002-06-14 13:40  torangan

	* undo
	  of
	  the
	  last

	  idea
	  after
	  all

2002-06-14 11:34  torangan

	* moved
	  PingusHolder*
	  pingus

	  from
	  the
	  AM_GNU_GETTEXT
	  macro)

2002-06-12 11:08  torangan

2002-06-12 10:40  torangan

	  *
	  and
	  moved
	  the
	  iterator
	  typedef to
	  the
	  .cc
	  -
	  this
	  should
	  prevent

	  instantiation
	  through
	  the
	  .hh

2002-06-11 18:28  torangan

	  really
	  required
	  headers

	  fixed
	  the
	  owner_id
	  bug,
	  it

	  caused
	  by
	  the
	  constructor
	  not
	  initing
	  the
	  variables
	  to
	  there
	  default
	  value -
	  some
	  more
	  classes
	  might
	  be
	  have
	  throuble
	  due
	  to
	  this
	  issue

2002-06-09 13:03  grumbel

	* -
	  replaced
	  shared_ptr<WorldObjData>
	  with
	  WorldObjData* -
	  the
	  changes
	  trigger
	  a
	  bug
	  in
	  the
	  owner_id,
	  which
	  causes
	  it
	  to
	  be
	  uninitialized,
	  not
	  sure
	  if
	  my
	  new
	  code
	  causes
	  this,
	  or
	  just
	  triggers
	  it
	  (since
	  I
	  have
	  seen
	  that
	  before)

2002-06-09 11:18  grumbel

	  this
	  commit
	  is
	  incomplete,
	  it
	  compiles,
	  but
	  segfault
	  at
	  level
	  startup,
	  will
	  fix
	  that
	  tomorrow
	  if
	  I
	  find

	  method
	  calls

2002-06-07 14:50  torangan

	* removed
	  dummy_ptr
	  -
	  this
	  reduces
	  compile
	  time,
	  footprint
	  and
	  complexity. There
	  was
	  no
	  point
	  where
	  it

	  and
