To compile the CVS version, first run ./autogen.sh, after that then
the normal ./configure && make stuff. You need ClanLib0.5 CVS to get
this version compiled.
The current CVS version requires that you start Pingus through the
wrapper script src/run_static.sh.

A lot of levels are broken at the moment.
