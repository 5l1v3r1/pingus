.SH DESCRIPTION
Pingus is a side-scrolling puzzle game where the player has to
guide a group of penguins from the entrance of a level to the
exit, in between the path is blocked by numerous obstacles and
dangers that the player has to overcome by assigning actions to
the penguins.
.SH ACTIONS
.TP 
Basher
The Basher will to a horizontal dig, leaving behind it a
tunnel. It is not able to dig through metal.

other penguins to turn around when they reach him.
.TP

surrounding ground with it.
.TP 
Bridger
The Bridger will build a small bridge, useful for crossing
small chasm.
.TP 
Climber
The Climber actions allows a Pingu to travel upwards a
vertical wall. Unlike other actions the climber action is
a permanent addition to the Pingus ability.
.TP 
Digger
The Digger will dig a hole into the ground. It can't dig
through metal.
.TP 
Floater
The Floater action will give a penguin a small propeller
that lets him gently glide down from great heights that
would otherwise be deadly.
.TP 
Jumper

allowing him to cross chasm and small vertical obstacles.
.TP 
Miner
The Miner will dig a diagonal hole into the ground.
.TP

belly for a short while, allowing the Pingu to make it
through narrow tunnels.

.TP 
sdl
A simple software renderer based on SDL, this

.TP 
opengl
The OpenGL renderer will use hardware
acceleration to render the graphics, it is much
faster then the SDL renderer and recommended when
the hardware supports OpenGL.
.TP 
delta
The delta renderer uses SDL for rendering and
doesn't use hardware acceleration, it will however
try to increase rendering performance by only re
rendering screen elements that have changed. Using
the delta renderer will disable some effects such
as scrolling background to allow maximum
benefits.
