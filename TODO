Release Critical:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Resource aren't found from time to time, even if they are present
   (probably a memory problem, time for efence I guess)
 o Miner graebt durch solid
 o Add feature flag to list features compiled into pingus
 o You can scroll when you shoudn't be able to scroll (800x600)
 o bottom tiles aren't displayed
 o climber capturing doesn't work
 o check for ./configure --disable-sound
 o bottom tile isn't draw (foliage1.plf)
 o many segfaults when quitting the game
 o Basher doesn't care about solid objects
 o Change the config file syntax
 o groundpiece type (transparent, ...) editable from the editor
 o verbose level sorting
   0. no output at all, only on segfault and exit
   1. Creation of main game components
   2. other important game events
   3. Loading of data
 o Bridger, if in waiting state, can recive another new action
 o Editor doesn't handle entrance direction!!
 o fix themes
 o Position of cap rect doesn't fit for climber
 o miner and basher needs to be slower
 o *.wav not found erros if sound is disabled.
 o test if put_target() works or where it fails (small surfaces?!)
 o basher isn't falling if he goes over a hole in the ground
 o Splashed can be captured.
 o Bombers with unlimited actions turn crazy
 o z_pos handlig im editor braucht nen fix
 o miner doesn't dick to the complete ground, some pixel are left.
 o QuickPlay sollte den Level anzeigen, bzw entfernt werden.
 o Jumper harken sich fest
 o glibc2.1 as requirement auf Pingus site

Probably fixed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Segfault when the quit button is pressed
 o Standard World braucht hoeheren feuer-hintergrund. [anderer hintergrund]
 o Segfaults in CL_MouseCursor...?! [gibt es hwcursor]
 o Mouse Zeiger im Result screen
 o Zerquetschte Pinguine sollten keine Pixel werfen (smasher)
 o Bridger verhacken sich in Waenden
 o Pingus splash even if they are floaters if they were to fast when the
   floater was appied
 o Colmap manipulation for traps, entrances, etc.
 o if level is smaller than screen, no tiles are drawn
 o Sometimes when I make one pingus explode, many others explode.

Wishlist:
~~~~~~~~~
 o Level replay should be possible without reloading
 o Limit liquids to multiples of width, get rid of cliprect stuff
 o Demo Mode/automatisches abspielen von demos 
 o put_target() with alpha channel doesn't work (opace blits)
 o Extrem kleine Maps klappen nicht (overdrawing)
 o ButtonPanel needs to be rewritten/redesigned.
 o Hotkeys fuers Main menu.
 o Wolkenausgang, so dass ne Bruecke zum erreichen benoetigt wird.
 o ClanLibs X11 implementation needs to use X11 events... normal queries
   doesn't work very well... 
 o 'map' might be an reserved keyword
 o cache the level map for a fast restart
