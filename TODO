Roadmap for Pingus 0.8.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Important" Stuff and Random Notes:
===================================

* CollisionMask cleanup

* static in Entrance direction=misc is ugly

* small levels in large windows cause parallax scrolling to break

* add "Save Demo" to the result screen

* add "Replay" to the result screen

* incooperate xskat levels

* animate the flag or remove it for single-player

* make GUI resizable

* shadow in levelset background is wrong

* split blackboard graphic into foreground and background, draw seperatly to get cleaner resize

* playfield scrolling should be float

* generate thumbnails for the editor, loading times are inacceptable

* Repaint Exit pannel

* write level 'screenshot' tool

* split Pingus into base and extra user contributed content

* rename WorldMapManager to WorldMapScreen, split WorldMapComponent into seperate file

* intro/end credits are not properly displayed currently

* do SurfaceButton with signals

New Features
============

* split screen multiplayer

* keep highscores for levels (number saved and stuff like that)

Wishlist:
=========

* particle pingu explosions are rects, should be circles
  (Vel(rand()%10, rand()%10) vs Vel(angle, length))

* Change current pause/forward behaviour:

  - add VCR like effect for fast forward

  - add slow motion button (dead, turtle, pingu, rabbit)

* move time into pingus counter

* make option menu accessible from in-game (top/left corner)

Animation and graphic issues:
=============================

* convert all Pingu animations to a proper indexed format so that
  palette swap can be used in multiplayer

* proper waiter animation (use the one from SuperTux? draw new one)

* repaint pause and fast-forward button

* use transparent action buttons unless fast-mode is used

* add round corners to the minimap

* allow sprites as background (para parameter from hotspots?)

* redesign main menu

* animate the exit flag

* rework the UI, either go glas-like or use the blackbord style 

* X-Mas theme needs some more polish, to be done before X-Mas '08

* create jumper animation

Bugs:
=====

* Also, is this a already solved bug? I can play
> playable/panic-cbrucher.pingus but when I am playing I get this error in
> terminal and then the window closes.
> " PingusError: e has wrong color depth: "


* GroundMap tiles are currently RGBA, while in reality they are just
  RGB with a colorkey, room for optimization

* file parsing easily crashes or asserts on incorrect files

* Translation issues:

 - The suffix showing which extra skill a Pingus has (e.g. [f] for Floater or
   [c] for Climber). (will be fixed by climber gfx)

 - b) The big sign on the 'Tutorial Island' image

* digger (mean basher?) follows down slopes

* worldmap pingu walks right over locked levels

* paint climber

Unsorted:
=========

* Font::draw() origin only works properly for left, right and center, breaks with multiline text

* implement xschema-like language to check for syntax errors in the level files

* trap in one tutorial level with two exits is in background, should
  be foreground (???)

* Wiimote support (libcwiid)

* do we need z-pos for anything or does implicit object position serve
  the same purpose? Problem: Groundpieces all have the same z-level,
  the editor doesn't handle that and allows insertions inbetween

* pregenerate thumbnails for the editor, generating them takes to long


Roadmap for Pingus 0.7.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:
=============

* implement option menu

* rewrite Config file support, make game automatically write a default
  config file, use s-expr, goes hand in hand with the new option menu

* add cheats: all actions, unlimited actions, skip level, these must
  be triggerable via maintainer-mode, not via commandline switch

* generate MES-1 fonts and add UTF-8 support to the Font system
  (http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?comp1=MES-1&comp2=)

* CollisionMask can't handle RGBA images and likely shouldn't (due to
  them being animated and stuff like that), we however don't have
  seperate colmask for those images

* remove flip_screen_hook

* test wall-jump: maybe make it smaller then a normal jump

* make climber attach to wall after jumper 


Bugs:
=====

* resource system needs a rewrite/implementation

* "core/misc/404sprite" should be returned for missing graphics

* Level Converter needs to be finalized:

  - convert all levels and check all classic levels for issues, also compare with xskat

  - level converter has a bug that causes some object types to be
    ignored (startpos and likely the other more excotic worldobj
    things)

  - fix the level convert script and write test cases for it

  - Loading data/levels/playable/chouser02.pingus in Editor and saving
    it again causes the background to be at the wrong position (caused
    by level lacking position and editor setting a different fallback
    then in-game) [Currently worked around in editor code, should be
    fixed in the converter]

* frameskip seems broken

* bridging gets more complicated has graphical error (background?!)
  surface background doesn't handle larger res due to the Playfield
  being offsetted (might be solvable with new DrawingContext that
  features Rect)

* parallax scrolling is funky where background tiles are small. When
  scrolling right, the leftmost column of tiles gets overlapped by the
  next column a little bit. See the last tutorial level for an
  example. (likely rounding error float/int)

* StringFormat does line breaking TeX-style, but that isn't useful
  with the current s-expr format, which can handle explicit line
  breaks just fine

* http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21176
To replicate:
1. Order a pingu to build a bridge.
2. When he "waits" after the bridge has been complete, order him to block.
3. He'll fall off the end of the bridge and continue walking as normal.

Wishlist Stuff:
===============

* The goal should be to provide fullscreen support for most common
  monitors -> levels should have a minimum size of 1920x1200

* FPS: issues, SDL_Delay() calls should be limited to ScreenManager: 

  - Editor:     27fps - 20%
  - Main Menu:  30fps - 50%
  - Worldmap:   50fps - 22%
  - Starscreen: 19fps - 14%
  - Game:       32fps - 14%
  - EndScreen:  50fps - 19%

* integrate install command into scons (maybe), use 'install' instead of 'cp'

* remove --verbose or make it an alias for --debug all

* add dynamic resize for the game, problematic due to scaled
  backgrounds, might be easier to do if backgrounds would be handled
  more flexible (seperate background gradient from cloud objects and
  stuff like that)

* Liquids/water is 32, others are 64, this is causing trouble with the
  collision map

Undecided stuff: ================

* start_pos is missing in editor (worked around by centering the view
  on the entrances)

* implemented input/ComboButton for Shift+Tab combinations

* add something like FileReader::must_read_int() for cases where a
  value isn't optional, something that can figure out values that
  havn't be used would be nice as well

* some people like auto-scrolling in window mode, in 0.6.0 it worked
  even when completly out of the window, in SDL the mouse coords don't
  get updated when the mouse isn't in the window (need to switch from
  event to polling?!)

* action-axis doesn't handle analog (do we even need this or could we do with axis-button?)

* remove SceneContext from Credits, replace with DrawingContext

* sv.po, Swedish is incomplete, lacks level and story text

* story graphics have a missing vertical line (due to age old gimp scaling bug)
 
* add drag&drop scrolling

* nuke button is unclean, other buttons not so great either -> repaint

* walker speed looks wrong, other actions might need fine tuning as well

* write a README.input

* LANG=sr ./pingus|grep language shows "English" but ingame text is not English

* using some languages (sr, cs, tr) causes some kind of font mapping errors

* replace "magic" numbers such as default screen size (800 and 600) with macros/globals or whatever is good programming practice

Roadmap for Pingus Editor 0.7.4:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important:
==========

* remove support for obsolete tags: 

  - liquid/speed
  - hotpost/speed
  - hotpost/parallax (replace with para-x, para-y)

* Pack some new levels: indiana

* keep-aspect is missing in the editor

Medium Important:
=================

* shrinking the editor window to much causes a crash (limit size as temporary fix)

* implement proper tmpfile Support (save tmp levels to ~/.pingus/tmp/
  for backup purpose in case of editor crash or so)

* add yes/no question when creating a new level

* add overwrite warning to file dialog

* add pixel perfect object selection

* add icons to filedialog

* Dialogs: Editor Properties: user name and email

* show an error message if save fails

Less Important:
===============

* make inputbox handle text longer then the rect size as well as
  multiline text

* keyboard shortcuts need to be implemented with input framework, but
  how without support for keymaps?

* ObjectSelector need to support more object types, missing types:
  all kinds of traps, weather, special objects

* add type conversion (important to convert groundpieces in hotspots and visa verse)

* add options to show/hide hidden files and filter stuff

* could/should rotate around object center

* write a color select widget (Hue, Saturation.Value)

* object raising doesn't work for group


Older Stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

* smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

* all working actions in default level

* seperate colmap and gfx remover surfaces for digger, miner, etc. would be nice
  the current ones don't work very good since the remove path is too smooth
  - keep_trans,alpha blitters would also be very nice (darken the border of a digging path or something like that)

* diggers leave a small pixel barier when finished with there digging,
  which can be abused as a step

* replace all '9000' time levels with '-1' time or correct time

* fix author in all levels

* update email addrs and missing author fields in level files

* floater and jumper don't work together

* hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

* smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

* console is bound to the wrong keys and keys for it are not documented

* music and sound should be up and running and included in the game [important - release critical]

* playable and non-playable levels should be sorted

* add better load-from-file support for hotspots, backgrounds, etc.

* pingus doesn't die when out-of-screen

* result screens

* html like behaviour for level descriptions

* description screen and result screen must be reworked

* thumbnail handling should be reviewed

* Floaters shouldn't float until they've fallen the minimum distance
  it'd take for a regular Pingu to splat. That way, you wouldn't have to
  worry about floaters moving so slowly a lot of the time, when
  unnecessary

* Bashers cut in circles, so their last two or three swipes should be
  square when breaking through to an open space, since they currently
  can trap Pingu in, requiring another one or two bashes. This is
  especially obvious when bashing through wells. They can also bash
  through metal, which they shouldn't be able to.

* All entrances should have graphics and be animated

* Bridgers seem to move backwards when they first start stacking (I
  think that their graphic may be more to the left in its square than
  the walker graphic, and also a little smaller than the walker
  graphic - probably because it's confined to a square of the same
  size - maybe give special workers slightly larger graphic sizes, so
  they can appear to be the same size as walkers)

* Sometimes diggers can't be changed into miners.

* If enough Pingu are saved and all that are left are blockers, end
  level before time runs out, with a win

* At least one kind of water (the kind in Evil in the Dark) doesn't
  kill Pingu

* In space levels, Pingu that fall off of a cliff into space don't
  die, though they should just like in water or lava.

Missing Groundpieces
====================

Desert Theme:
 - all bocks need to be available as solid in addition to the
   non-solid blocks, some level already abuse the non-solid blocks as
   solid.

Sortie Theme:
 - this theme needs 'normal' groundpieces which can be used to dig
   throught and things like that, it currently only has horizontal and
   vertical bars, which make building levels quite difficult

Really Old Stuff:
=================

* A better MessageBox
* caching for level prviews
* more ground gfx's
* Better music support

* right/left/random/left'n'right for entrances
* Support for animated exits and entrances
* More Backgrounds (tileable/fullscreen/resized)
* Creating some sound effects
* Integrading Demo recording/playing to the menu    
* snow particles
* A ground smashing animation

0.4.0
~~~~~

* Parallax scrolling backgrounds
* All standard actions fine tuned working actions

1.0.0
~~~~~
