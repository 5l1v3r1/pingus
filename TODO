Release Checklist:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- turn on fullscreen at default (do we really want this with
  fullscreen key documented?)

- make sure all important strings are translatable

- run ./extract-po.sh && ./update-po.sh

- update ChangeLog

Stuff to do at all times:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- grep for all the FIXME's and '#if 0' and find those that might be
  important, add what you find to this TODO

Roadmap for Pingus 0.8.0:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- pingu explosions are rects, should be circles (Vel(rand()%10, rand()%10) vs Vel(angle, length))

- add VCR like effect for fast forward

- add slow motion button (dead, turtle, pingu, rabbit)

- move time into pingus counter

- make option menu accessible from in-game (top/left corner)

- proper waiter animation

- repaint pause and fast-forward button

- use transparent action buttons unless fast-mode is used

- add round corners to the minimap

- allow sprites as background

- add a proper option menu

- redesign main menu

- animate the exit flag

- a new worlds 

- UTF8 support with MES-1 characters (http://www.eki.ee/letter/chardata.cgi?comp1=MES-1&comp2=)

- split screen multiplayer

- editor isn't working

- rework the UI, either go glas-like or use the blackbord style 

- Font::draw() origin only works properly for left, right and center, breaks with multiline text

- file parsing easily crashes or asserts on incorrect files

- GroundMap tiles are currently RGBA, while in reality they are just
  RGB with a colorkey, room for optimization

- implement xschema-like language to check for syntax errors in the level files

- keep highscores for levels (number saved and stuff like that)

- digger follows down slopes

- trap in one tutorial level with two exits is in background, should be foreground

- worldmap pingu walks right over locked levels

- Wiimote support (libcwiid)

- Translation issues:

 * The suffix showing which extra skill a Pingus has (e.g. [f] for Floater or
   [c] for Climber).

 * b) The big sign on the 'Tutorial Island' image

- do we need z-pos for anything or does implicit object position serve
  the same purpose? Problem: Groundpieces all have the same z-level,
  the editor doesn't handle that and allows insertions inbetween

Roadmap for Pingus 0.7.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important:
==========

- create verdana11 for latin2 and latin9

- miner remove graphics looks wrong (cmap instead of gfx?), others too (digger)

### Loading font file: system://data/images/fonts/courier_small-iso-8859-9.font
Font: datadir://images/fonts/courier_small-iso-8859-9.png
  Error: glyphs found: 188, expected 189
  Format: bpp: 32


Less Important:
===============

- bridging gets more complicated has graphical error (background?!)
  surface background doesn't handle larger res due to the Playfield
  being offsetted (might be solveable with new DrawingContext that
  features Rect)

- menu crashes when you click a little wildely

- rewrite Config file support, make game automatically write a default
  config file, use s-expr

- level converter has a bug that causes some object types to be
  ignored (startpos and likely the other more excotic worldobj things)

- level converter writes 0/1 instead of #t/#f

- "core/misc/404sprite" isn't returned for missing graphics

- disable fade-over when fast-mode is active

- Liquids/water is 32, others are 64, this is causing trouble with the
  collision map

- separate gfx/colmap surfaces aren't used

- rework command line parsing so that it actually works properly and
  doesn't depend so much on the order (setting datadir causes trouble
  with translation, since translation need datadir to work)

- some people like auto-scrolling in window mode, in 0.6.0 it worked
  even when completly out of the window, in SDL the mouse coords don't
  get updated when the mouse isn't in the window (need to switch from
  event to polling?!)

- action-axis doesn't handle analog (do we even need this or could we do with axis-button?)

- fix memory leaks in input/ (Controller doesn't clean up)

- remove SceneContext from Credits, replace with DrawingContext

- rapidly clicking the main menu buttons causes the game to crash

- jumper dies sometimes in data/levels/tutorial/snow11-grumbel.scm when hitting the ground

- resource system needs a review

- sv.po, Swedish is incomplete, lacks level and story text

- story graphics have a missing vertical line (due to age old gimp scaling bug)

- CollisionMask can't handle RGBA images and likely shouldn't (due to
  them being animated and stuff like that), we however don't have
  seperate colmask for those images

- convert all levels and check all classic levels for issues (run
  branches/pingus_sdl/contribl/levelconvert.sh from SVN toplevel dir)
 
- add drag&drop scrolling

- nuke button is unclean, other buttons not so great either -> repaint

- walker speed looks wrong, other actions might need fine tuning as well

- hurry-up should be removed and replaced by something less heavy
  (isn't used in tutorial island, since those levels don't have time)
  (have a blinking clock and tick sound or so)

- write a README.input

Roadmap for Pingus Editor 0.7.1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important:
==========

- all done!

Less Important:
===============

- implement proper tmpfile Support (save tmp levels to ~/.pingus/tmp/
  for backup purpose in case of editor crash or so)

- keyboard shortcuts need to be implemented (use input framework, but
  how without support for keymaps?)

  a       - select all
  shift+click - add object to selection/remove from selection
  d       - duplicate
  delete  - delete object
  insert  - show/hide objectselector
  cursor  - pixel width moves (alternative: hold a button for slow moves)
  f       - hflip
  shift+f - vflip
  r       - rotate90
  shift+r - rotate270

- ObjectSelector need to support more object types, missing types:
  all kinds of traps, weather, special objects

- add yes/no question when creating a new level

- add type conversion (important to convert groundpieces in hotspots and visa verse)

- add options to show/hide hidden files and filter stuff

- added overwrite warning to file dialog

- add pixel perfect object selection

- implement a minimap (just rects when surfaces are to tricky)

- could/should rotate around object center

- write a color select widget (Hue, Saturation.Value)

- object raising doesn't work for group

- add icons to filedialog

- Dialogs: Editor Properties: user name and email

- parallax scrolling is funky where background tiles are small. When scrolling right, the leftmost column of tiles gets overlapped by the next column a little bit. See the last tutorial level for an example.

- decide whether to ignore cached_action != CA_NONE in ScreenManager::pop_screen. This causes the game to crash if [ESC] is quickly pressed repeatedly


Older Stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

- smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

- all working actions in default level

- seperate colmap and gfx remover surfaces for digger, miner, etc. would be nice
  the current ones don't work very good since the remove path is too smooth
  - keep_trans,alpha blitters would also be very nice (darken the border of a digging path or something like that)

- diggers leave a small pixel barier when finished with there digging,
  which can be abused as a step

- replace all '9000' time levels with '-1' time or correct time

- fix author in all levels

- update email addrs and missing author fields in level files

- floater and jumper don't work together

- hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

- smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

- console is bound to the wrong keys and keys for it are not documented

- music and sound should be up and running and included in the game [important - release critical]

- playable and non-playable levels should be sorted

- add better load-from-file support for hotspots, backgrounds, etc.

- pingus doesn't die when out-of-screen

- result screens

- html like behaviour for level descriptions

- description screen and result screen must be reworked

- thumbnail handling should be reviewed

- Floaters shouldn't float until they've fallen the minimum distance
  it'd take for a regular Pingu to splat. That way, you wouldn't have to
  worry about floaters moving so slowly a lot of the time, when
  unnecessary

- Bashers cut in circles, so their last two or three swipes should be
  square when breaking through to an open space, since they currently
  can trap Pingu in, requiring another one or two bashes. This is
  especially obvious when bashing through wells. They can also bash
  through metal, which they shouldn't be able to.

- All entrances should have graphics and be animated

- Bridgers seem to move backwards when they first start stacking (I
  think that their graphic may be more to the left in its square than
  the walker graphic, and also a little smaller than the walker
  graphic - probably because it's confined to a square of the same
  size - maybe give special workers slightly larger graphic sizes, so
  they can appear to be the same size as walkers)

- Sometimes diggers can't be changed into miners.

- If enough Pingu are saved and all that are left are blockers, end
  level before time runs out, with a win

- "Hurry up!" wayyy too late. Maybe at 1 minute left, or so.

- At least one kind of water (the kind in Evil in the Dark) doesn't
  kill Pingu

- In space levels, Pingu that fall off of a cliff into space don't
  die, though they should just like in water or lava.

Missing Groundpieces
====================

Desert Theme:
 - all bocks need to be available as solid in addition to the
   non-solid blocks, some level already abuse the non-solid blocks as
   solid.

Sortie Theme:
 - this theme needs 'normal' groundpieces which can be used to dig
   throught and things like that, it currently only has horizontal and
   vertical bars, which make building levels quite difficult
