Roadmap for Pingus 0.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- add VCR like effect for fast forward

- add slow motion button (dead, turtle, pingu, rabbit)

- move time into pingus counter

- make option menu accessible from in-game (top/left corner)

- proper waiter animation

- repaint pause and fast-forward button

- use transparent action buttons unless fast-mode is used

- add round corners to the minimap

- allow sprites as background

- add a proper option menu

- redesign main menu

- animate the exit flag

- a new worlds 

- UTF8 support

- split screen multiplayer

- editor isn't working

- rework the UI, either go glas-like or use the blackbord style 

- Font::draw() origin only works properly for left, right and center break with multiline text

- file parsing easily crashes or asserts on incorrect files

- GroundMap tiles are currently RGBA, while in reality they are just
  RGB with a colorkey, room for optimization

Roadmap for Pingus 0.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important:
==========

- copy all translations in level files over to the LANG.po file (take care of encoding!)


- paralax handling is different between 0.6 and SDL, see
  data/levels/playable/slidenride1-grumbel.pingus

- grep for all the FIXME's and '#if 0' and find those that might be
  important, add what you find to this TODO

- update INSTALL.* file

- remove all the remaining unneeded debuging std::cout's

- Latin1 clean (also Latin-2 and Latin-9, see:
  http://kapsa.cz/~tomasb/pingus/intl-patch.tgz)

- src/components/pingus_counter.hpp font should be fixed-width/monospace

- forgein languages break many parts of the GUI


Nice to Have:
=============

- sv.po - ISO-8859-1 - (incomplete)

- story graphics have a missing vertical line (due to age old gimp scaling bug)

- separate gfx/colmap surfaces aren't used

- CollisionMask can't handle RGBA images and likely shouldn't (due to
  them being animated and stuff like that), we however don't have
  seperate colmask for those images

- convert all levels and check all classic levels for issues (run
  branches/pingus_sdl/contribl/levelconvert.sh from SVN toplevel dir)

- Liquids/water is 32, others are 64, this is causing trouble with the
  collision map

- add drag&drop scrolling

- nuke button is unclean, other buttons not so great either -> repaint

- walker speed looks wrong, other actions might need fine tuning as well

- hurry-up should be removed and replaced by something less heavy
  (isn't used in tutorial island, since those levels don't have time)

- remove unneeded/outdated fonts

- "core/misc/404sprite" isn't returned for missing graphics

Older Stuff:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

- smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

- all working actions in default level

- seperate colmap and gfx remover surfaces for digger, miner, etc. would be nice
  the current ones don't work very good since the remove path is too smooth
  - keep_trans,alpha blitters would also be very nice (darken the border of a digging path or something like that)

- diggers leave a small pixel barier when finished with there digging,
  which can be abused as a step

- replace all '9000' time levels with '-1' time or correct time

- fix author in all levels

- update email addrs and missing author fields in level files

- floater and jumper don't work together

- hint system via herring or flower (it should show the path to walk)

- smasher doesn't correctly check the y-coordinate

- console is bound to the wrong keys and keys for it are not documented

- music and sound should be up and running and included in the game [important - release critical]

- playable and non-playable levels should be sorted

- add better load-from-file support for hotspots, backgrounds, etc.

- pingus doesn't die when out-of-screen

- result screens

- html like behaviour for level descriptions

- description screen and result screen must be reworked

- thumbnail handling should be reviewed

- Floaters shouldn't float until they've fallen the minimum distance
  it'd take for a regular Pingu to splat. That way, you wouldn't have to
  worry about floaters moving so slowly a lot of the time, when
  unnecessary

- Bashers cut in circles, so their last two or three swipes should be
  square when breaking through to an open space, since they currently
  can trap Pingu in, requiring another one or two bashes. This is
  especially obvious when bashing through wells. They can also bash
  through metal, which they shouldn't be able to.

- All entrances should have graphics

- Bridgers seem to move backwards when they first start stacking (I
  think that their graphic may be more to the left in its square than
  the walker graphic, and also a little smaller than the walker
  graphic - probably because it's confined to a square of the same
  size - maybe give special workers slightly larger graphic sizes, so
  they can appear to be the same size as walkers)

- Sometimes diggers can't be changed into miners.

- If enough Pingu are saved and all that are left are blockers, end
  level before time runs out, with a win

- "Hurry up!" wayyy too late. Maybe at 1 minute left, or so.

- At least one kind of water (the kind in Evil in the Dark) doesn't
  kill Pingu

- In space levels, Pingu that fall off of a cliff into space don't
  die, though they should just like in water or lava.

Missing Groundpieces
====================

Desert Theme:
 - all bocks need to be available as solid in addition to the
   non-solid blocks, some level already abuse the non-solid blocks as
   solid.

Sortie Theme:
 - this theme needs 'normal' groundpieces which can be used to dig
   throught and things like that, it currently only has horizontal and
   vertical bars, which make building levels quite difficult
