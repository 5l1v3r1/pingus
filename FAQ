   Question:
   
   Pingus 0.2.2 fails to compile:
        In file included from PingusSpotMap.cc:20:
        blitter.hh:24: `CL_LockableSurface' was not declared in this scope
        blitter.hh:24: `provider' was not declared in this scope
        blitter.hh:24: parse error before `*'


   Answer:
   
   Sorry there are some problems with the Pingus 0.2.2 release. Pingus
   0.2.2 won't compile with ClanLib 0.1.18.
   But there is a simple workaround:
   Add the following line to the middle of
   /usr/local/include/ClanLib/clanlib.h or where ever you installed
   ClanLib:
                #include "Layer1/Display/API/lockable_surface.h"
        

   After that try again to compile Pingus.

   Question:
   
   Where can I download the CVS version of ClanLib, I can't find it on
   the ClanLib page. Can You give me the URL?
   
   Answer:
   
   No, a CVS version cannot be downloaded in a normal way. CVS is a
   system to coordinate develoment of different programmers. To get a
   snapshot of a CVS version you have to do a checkout with cvs. Please
   read the infos given on the ClanLib page in the download section.

   Question:
   
   What the hell is lemmings, I haven't heard anything about it, can you
   give me a hint?
   
   Answer:
   
   Have a look at the Lemmings pages on the [13]Links page. For example
   the site [14]"The World of the Lemmings" is a good place to start.
            ____________________________________________________
   
   Question:
   
   I get, after typing 'pingus' a message like:
   libclan.so can't find file
   
   Answer:
   
   You forgot to run ldconfig after building ClanLib, so run ldconfig and
   redo a make in the pingus diretory, because the build may be
   incomplete.
            ____________________________________________________
   
   Question:
   
   I have installed ClanLib, but I still get the following message while
   running configure:
checking for a BSD compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether make sets ${MAKE}... (cached) yes
checking for ranlib... ranlib
checking how to run the C++ preprocessor... c++ -E
checking for ClanLib/clanlib.h... yes
checking for main in -lclan... no
Please get ClanLib from http://www.clanlib.org


   Answer:
   
   You need to run ldconfig after the make install of ClanLib. If that
   didn't help ensure that you have /usr/local/lib in your
   /etc/ld.so.conf. You you still can't configure pingus, please have a
   look at the file config.log. Mail it if you can't find out what is
   going on.

Development

   Question:
   Pingus is a nice project how can I help?
   
   Answer:
   
   Of coures, for a start have a look at the [15]development section of
   this page, for information, how you can help with the development. The
   best to do, is first subscribe to the mailing list and then have a
   look at the [16]task list
            ____________________________________________________
   
   Question:
   
   Why does Pingus use an uncommon libary like [17]ClanLib? Nobody has
   that libary and it makes compiling much harder?
   
   Answer:
   
   At the moment there aren't any common game programming libaries for
   linux. [18]ClanLib provides some nice features, like different display
   target (window, fullscreen, etc.) and at the moment it is the only
   portable high level 2D C++ libary that I know.
